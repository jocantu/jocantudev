    <h1 id="how-many-streets-are-named-after-women-figures">How many streets are named after women figures?</h1>
<p>Some days ago I heard at a local radio station a note about the gender inequality in streets names at my city, and this facts is repeated at different degrees all around the world but it is always interesting to analyze the local situation.</p>
<p>I know the tools so I decided to create a map to understand in a visual way where are these streets located.</p>
<p>The first step is getting the data, the logical first candidate is the local government. In México we have some websites offering open data to the public, but in this case there was not success, I also tried at the National Institute of Statistics and Geography but they do not have any information at this geographical low scale. There is always the option to solicitate in a formal letter this information but is a slow process which could take months to get a response and usually is not satisfactory.</p>
<p>I have worked before with Open Street Maps but I did not know it is possible to download layers of information from it, so one way to achieve this is by using the QGIS plugin called <a href="%22https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QuickOSM/%22">QuickOSM</a> that allows you to select different levels of information including all the streets in their database from your area of interest and export them to shp file.</p>
<p><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t5iDJxUS9Z4/Xy2GQtontjI/AAAAAAAACLc/ahq91TvXF5MuWifz70U9tJ7Ayrjugb6lQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1094/osmdownloader_data.png" alt="QuickOSM Screenshot"></p>
<p>So know the real challenge begins, how to identify the gender name of each street? From a short research on Internet I found similar projects from around the world and some of them are using a gender algorithm detection, such as <a href="%22https://www.namsor.com/%22">NamSor</a> which has free and paid accounts, for the free account you have a limit of only 500 names per month so I did some tests and found that it has problems to identify correctly neutral names.</p>
<p>Finally I opted to do it manually, after all there are only around 2,500 names and in just two hours of burning my eyes in an Excel spreadsheet and putting some colors and neon glow effect in QGIS the result was this:</p>
<p><img src="/img/gendermap.png" alt="Street Names Gender Map Torreón"></p>
<p>For now it is just a static image, but the idea is to create a web map using LeafletJS or any similar library, and if I find the time I want to develop a collaborative tool to identify the names online. I spend around two hours identifying names, so a team of 10 people would finish in less than 30 minutes, and It would be interesting to test or train an algorithm using this platform.</p>
